# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem (Week 1)
In each of the following examples we will be going over commands **cd** "change directory", **ls** "list files", and **cat** "concatenate".
## Examples using the commands with no arguments

*All of these examples were done in the home directory*
### cd 
This commands whole purpose is to change the directory you are in. If no argument is given, it does not know which directory you are wanting to change to so as a result nothing is done or shown.
### ls
This command lists or 'prints' the files and/or folder in the given path. Since no path is given, it printed the files and folder withing the current directory we were in. In this case we were in the home directory so it only printed 'lecture1' since that is the only folder in that directory.
### cat
This commands purpose is to print the contents of one or more files given by the provided path. This is an error because no path or argument was given, and it simply does not let you run it, ultimately jsut awaiting for user to unput path. User can use '^C' to exit.
## Examples using the commands with a path to a directory as an argument

*All of these examples were done in the home directory*
### cd
Now that the command has been given a path to follow, it can change the directory. The path given was '/home/lecture1/messages' so it should and did change to the messages directory. 
### ls
Now that the command has been given a path to follow, it can list all the files and/or folders. Since the path that I provided led to working directory messages, there was no need for an argument but for example purposes the path certainly helped to visualize how to properly use the command. As seen the the screenshot, with the given path, all the folders/files in the messages directory was printed.
### cat
