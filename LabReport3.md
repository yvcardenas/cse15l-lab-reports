# Lab Report 3 - Bugs and Commands
## Part 1 - Bugs
Choose one of the bugs from week 4's lab
### Chosen Bug: 
- A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
<br>JUnit test that has a failure-inducting input:
``` java

```
- An input that doesn’t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
<br>JUnit test that does not induce a failure: 
``` java

```
- The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
### The symptom:
![Image]()
- The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)
Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue.
``` java

```

``` java

```
The fix adresses the issue because 
## Part 2 - Researching Commands
- Consider the commands less, find, and grep. Choose one of them. Online, find 4 interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use the command you chose. To find information about the commands, a simple Web search like “find command-line options” will probably give decent results. There is also a built-in command on many systems called man (short for “manual”) that displays information about commands; you can use man grep, for example, to see a long listing of information about how grep works. Also consider asking ChatGPT!
- For example, we saw the -name option for find in class. For each of those options, give 2 examples of using it on files and directories from ./technical. Show each example as a code block that shows the command and its output, and write a sentence or two about what it’s doing and why it’s useful.
### Chosen Command: find
The find command is used to search for files and directories within a specified directory hierarchy
__Command-Line Option 1: "-type"__
<br>1. The first example for the 'type' option is using 'f' which searches for regular files. This is useful because 
<br>Command:
```
```
<br>Output:
```
```
<br>2. The second example for the 'type' option is using 'd' which searches for directories. This is useful because 
<br>Command:
```
```
<br>Output:
```
```
<br> __Command-Line Option 2:"-print"__
<br>1. The first example for the 'print' option is using '' which . This is useful because 
<br>Command:
```
```
<br>Output:
```
```
<br>2. The second example for the '' option is using '' which. This is useful because 
<br>Command:
```
```
<br>Output:
```
```
<br> __Command-Line Option 3:"-name"__
<br>1. The first example for the 'name' option is using '' which. This is useful because 
<br>Command:
```
```
<br>Output:
```
```
<br>2. The second example for the 'name' option is using '' which . This is useful because 
<br>Command:
```
```
<br>Output:
```
```
<br> __Command-Line Option 4:"-mtime n"__
<br>1. The first example for the 'mtime' option has n = 7 where the command searches for files modified approximately "n" days ago which in this case is 7 days. This is useful because 
<br>Command:
```
```
<br>Output:
```
```
<br>2. The second example for the 'mtime' option has n = 2 where the command searches for files modified approximately "n" days ago which in this case is 2 days. This is useful because 
<br>Command:
```
```
<br>Output:
```
```
- Along with each option/mode you show, cite your source for how you found out about it as a URL or a description of where you found it. See the syllabus on Academic Integrity and how to cite sources like ChatGPT for this class.
